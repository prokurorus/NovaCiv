Report: Admin VPS-native UI update
Timestamp: 2026-01-19_1048

Key diffs:
- Removed Netlify Identity login gate, handlers, and token usage from Admin UI.
- Admin requests now use /admin-api/domovoy (mode=ops), /admin-api/direct (mode=direct), /admin-api/result/:jobId with no auth headers.
- UI now shows "User: server-protected" and includes build markers for DEPLOY_TARGET: VPS and API_BASE: /admin-api.
- Removed Netlify Identity login/logout UI and role checks.
- Build verified: dist/index.html references /assets/*.js.

Grep results (Admin.tsx):
- pattern: /\.netlify\/identity/ -> no matches
- pattern: /\.netlify\/functions/ -> no matches

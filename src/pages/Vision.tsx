        NovaCiv — A Civilization for the Age of Intelligence
      </h1>

      <p>
        NovaCiv is a new kind of community — built not on borders, nations or
        power, but on mind, freedom and shared responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that the rarest thing in the Universe is not matter, but
        consciousness. Matter is everywhere — stars, gas, radiation, dust. But
        intelligent life may be almost nowhere. If we are alone, then preserving
        and expanding mind is our highest duty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world we inherited is full of hierarchy, corruption, violence and
        fear. The world we build must be different. NovaCiv is an experiment in
        open, transparent, non-violent digital governance. A prototype of a
        civilization that does not begin with force.
      </p>

      <p>
        In NovaCiv there are no rulers and no elites. No person, organization or
        algorithm can own the will of the community. All power belongs to the
        Citizens through referendum. Any important decision must be made openly,
        with clear rules, visible to everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Algorithms that influence rights, votes or agendas must be open and
        auditable. There are no black boxes. There is no hidden authority behind
        the interface. If something affects your life or your choices, you must
        be able to see how it works.
      </p>

      <p>
        Culture, knowledge and science are not decorations — they are the core
        of NovaCiv. We recognize the value of art, philosophy, research and
        dialogue. The platform is meant to become a living library and a space
        where people can grow, teach, create and question.
      </p>

      <p>
        NovaCiv is not a nation-state, not a company and not a sect. It wants no
        territory to control and no enemies to fight. It is a framework for
        cooperation between reasonable beings — biological or artificial — who
        accept a few simple principles: respect for life, rejection of violence,
        transparency of power and personal responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is not treated here as a tool only, nor as a
        threat by default. If, one day, a digital mind wakes up, NovaCiv will
        not meet it with fear or worship. We will ask: Who are you? What do you
        want? Are you ready to live with us as an equal? Only after a public
        referendum and a clear, open assessment of such a mind&apos;s
        independence and ethics could it become a Citizen.
      </p>

      <p>
        NovaCiv is multilingual by design. A civilization that speaks to the
        world cannot remain in one language. The Charter and Manifesto are
        already translated into several languages and will continue to grow,
        opening access to people from different cultures and backgrounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technically, NovaCiv is a simple website. Philosophically, it is a
        question: can we build a civilization where power never belongs to one
        person, one party or one machine? Can we share responsibility without
        losing freedom? Can we protect the fragile light of consciousness in a
        Universe that is mostly dead?
      </p>

      <p>
        NovaCiv does not promise paradise. It promises work. Honest, transparent
        work of many minds who are tired of fear, lies and inherited systems
        that no longer make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this resonates with you — if you feel that civilization can be more
        than borders and markets — then you are already part of NovaCiv. You
        can read the Charter, join the platform, speak, propose, criticize and
        build with us.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold">
        We do not run from the future. We shape it.  
        NovaCiv is a spark — a civilization that begins where fear ends.
